.SYNOPSIS
  TThis script will rename a group in Active Directory inside an OU. 
.DESCRIPTION
  This script will rename a group in Active Directory inside an OU. The example in here will ranem an ou 
  from something like GG-ADD-DIV-OU1-OU2-OU3-FC to GG-ADD-DIV-OU1_OU2_OU3-FC. Just replace the delimeter
  in the script with your delimeters as well as the number of delimiters.
  
  Disclaimer: This script is offered "as-is" with no warranty. 
  While the script is tested and working in my environment, it is recommended that you test the script
  in a test environment before using in your production environment.
